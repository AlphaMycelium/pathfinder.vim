[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/39c08aa4ab5468133a9c/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/AlphaMycelium/pathfinder.vim/maintainability)

A Vim plugin to give suggestions to improve your movements, by using Dijkstra's
pathfinding algorithm on cursor motions. It's a bit like [Clippy][office-assistant].

Every time you make a movement, a suggested optimal route appears - and if
you're using Vim 8.2 or above (`+popupwin`), you also get a short description
of what each motion does. To allow you to keep typing while it works, paths are
generated in a separate process, which runs Vim with a [barebones vimrc](serverrc.vim).

There is also a possibility of extending the script in the future to work with
other types of edits, such as operators, macros, marks and so on.

## Installation

Use your favorite plugin manager. I recommend
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

```vim
Plug 'AlphaMycelium/pathfinder.vim'
```

### Requirements

- `+python3`
- `+timers`
- `+popupwin` if you want to see help summaries next to the suggested motions

## Usage

1. Move the cursor in normal, visual or visual-line mode.
2. That's it.

Note that long-distance movements can take a while to process, especially on
low-end machines.

If your Vim has `+popupwin` (available since 8.2), you will see a popup at the
bottom of the screen containing the suggestion for the last movement you made,
along with a short description of what each motion does.

If not, the suggestion will be `echo`ed, in a single line without descriptions.

## Configuration

*pathfinder.vim works out-of-the box with the default configuration. You don't
need to read this section if you don't want to.*

### General settings

| Variable | Function |
| --- | --- |
| `g:pf_autorun_delay` | Time in seconds where no keypresses occur before starting pathfinding. Note that it also starts on other events such as entering insert mode.<br>*Default: 2* |
| `g:pf_server_communication_file` | Internal variable set automatically when launching the server Vim. **Do not set this manually, it will break everything.** |

### Motions

The plugin uses a global variable to set the available motions:

```vim
let g:pf_motions = [
  \ {'motion': 'h', 'weight': 1, 'description': 'Left {count} columns'},
  \ {'motion': 'l', 'weight': 1, 'description': 'Right {count} columns'},
  \ {'motion': 'j', 'weight': 1, 'description': 'Down {count} lines'},
  \ {'motion': 'k', 'weight': 1, 'description': 'Up {count} lines'},
  \ ...
  \ ]
```

This contains all the supported motions by default. If you do decide to change
it, you will need to copy the entire list out of [defaults.vim](plugin/defaults.vim)
(there is no way to edit a single motion without doing that).

Each motion has a weight associated with it. The higher the weight, the less
the pathfinding algorithm wants to use that motion. The path with the lowest
total weight wins. The default settings use the number of characters in the
motion as its weight.

However, repeating a motion will not use its predefined weight. Instead, the
cost is calculated based on the effect adding another repetition will have on
the string length of the count. This is easier to explain with examples:

| Motion | Cost of adding the repetition |
| --- | --- |
| `j` | (uses configured weight) |
| `j` -> `2j` | 1, since the `2` has been added |
| `2j` -> `3j` | 0, because `3j` is no longer than `2j` |
| `9j` -> `10j` | 1, since `10j` is a character longer than `9j` |
| `1j` -> `100j` | 2, since `100j` is 2 characters longer than `1j` |

Changes you could make:

- Increasing the weight of motions you don't like
- Deleting motions you never want to use
- Changing the order of motions to put the ones you prefer first
- Changing descriptions to be more understandable for you
